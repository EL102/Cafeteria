				<p class="text-xs mb-sm mx-auto" style="max-width: 35rem;">My name is Jared Ibañez, a second-year student at the Adventist University of the Philippines studying Information Technology. 

                Born at Cabanatuan —and raised in Puting Kahoy, Silang, Cavite, I’ve basically lived my life exploring and widening my horizons in this small town of Cavite. I’ve engaged in many activities of this school: small group, choir, —-, you name it! However, when I was invited to play with the computer, I was hooked. It made me connect with millions of people across the globe enhancing our skills in terms of intellect and memory via video games.</p>
